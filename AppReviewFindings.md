The first draft of this app uses mock data for the initial menu and event details. 

  #### What you can do:
    Search for recipes.
    Make changes to the event details such as address and event name. Note: this data is not stored when the page is refreshed, the mock data will appear. 

### User Review Notes
I've reviewed this application with at least 4 people who would use this type of app. Following are my findings.

- Observations
    - When screen is large enough, display the google map beside the event location
    - Make the recipe results smaller and display more then 3 results on the screen
    - Functionality to manage menu items, such as deletion, renaming, assigning atttendee as contributer to a menu item
    - Functionality to have multiple  hosts.
    - On smaller screen, reduce the size of the recipe display.
    - Display headcount of the total expected attendees.
    - Allow management of the attendees such as adding, removing attendees.
    - Display next to the menu items which person(s) contributed to the item.
    - When user clicks a contributer name, display all items which has been assigned to this person.
    - On larger screens display the courses in columns so that you can possibly see all courses without scrolling in the menu section.
